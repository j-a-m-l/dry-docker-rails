# docker-rails
This `docker-compose.yml` installs RoR.


# Environments
The root `docker-compose.yml` is the base of the environment specific configurations, so it does not links containers, nor creates the volumes.

* All the environments have a `.env` file that defines the `PostgreSQL` credentials.

## Development
Exposes ports 980 and 9443, so it should not conflict with your local servers.
`docker-compose -f ./environments/development/docker-compose.yml up -d`

## Production
Exposes ports 80 and 443.
`docker-compose -f ./environments/production/docker-compose.yml up -d`


# Data

# Web

# Configuration

## Installation configuration
